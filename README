Samoro.st: A personal website of mine.

============================================================

A website where I share anything that comes to my mind âˆ’ now
with 140% more backend stuffz!

How it works:

* The base PHP templates and contents of blogposts are compiled
  and statically generated with Hugo[1]

* The webserver redirects all POST HTTP requests to a daemon
  (comments/main.go). The POST requests are interpreted as
  comments submitted via a form on the website. If they fit
  the criteria, the daemon sanitizes and inserts them into a
  Postgresql database.

* The PHP code then fetches required data from Postgresql
  and displays them to the user as comments together with
  the rest of the previously statically generated content.

The best part? No Javascript required for any of this to
work! The few lines of in-line JS in the project serve only
for minor conveniences, like restoring scroll location after
page refresh.

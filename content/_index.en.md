# Intro

Hi, I'm *Jan Doskočil* and this is my website. Here I'll share anything I
consider worth writing about. That mostly includes GNU/linux, DNS and my
general opinions on society and current events.

I like wall climbing, my guitar and programming free software (mostly in C). In
that order.

Feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:honza@samoro.st">`honza@samoro.st`</a>.
Check your spam folder for the answer though − I run my own mailserver which all
but ensures I'm constantly on someone's blocklist.

I would prefer it if you PGP encrypted any mail you might want to send me. Get
my key from *[keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org)* or from [here](/dat/pubkey.gpg).

# Intro

Hi, I'm *Jan Doskočil* and this is my website. Here I'll share anything I
consider worth writing about. That mostly includes linux, DNS and my general
opinions on society and current events.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

Feel free to shoot me an email at `honza@samoro.st`. Check your spam folder for
the answer though − I run my own mailserver which all but ensures I'm
constantly on someone's blocklist.

I would prefer it if you PGP encrypted any mail you might want to send me. Get
my key from *hkps://keys.openpgp.org* or from [here](/pubkey.gpg).

PGP fingerprint:

# Bookmarks

Sometimes I happen to find something on the Internet, which I believe could be
*interesting or inspiring* to others. I'll keep references to such findings on
this page, each with a short description.

## Life

[**lukesmith.xyz**](https://lukesmith.xyz)
: Luke's [videos](https://videos.lukesmith.xyz) and
[articles](https://lukesmith.xyz/articles) have, possibly more than anything,
formed my current worldview. My current stance on issues like faith, how to
treat others or even what *software* to use has been massively influenced by
him.

[**Varg Vikernes**](https://odysee.com/@AncestralCult:0)
: I guess it's *weird* for a christian to look up to a self-proclaimed *"pagan"*
and, in his youth, a convicted arsonist of several Norwegian churches. But if
you look past that, he is a man with incredibly strong conviction and a
lifestyle any moral person can't help but draw inspiration from.

## Programming & Software

[**suckless**](https://suckless.org/)
: Very efficient, very minimalistic user-space software for *GNU/Linux*.

[**SUSv4/POSIX**](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
: *Single Unix Specification* specifies common OS interfaces and system
utilities. Any OS/distribution which calls itself *UNIX* must adhere to this
standard.

[**Anatomy of a syscall**](https://lwn.net/Articles/604287/)
: A great series on *lwn.net* discussing the internals of syscalls in
*Linux*.

[**dnsviz**](https://dnsviz.net/)
: A handy tool for DNS(SEC) debugging.

## Media

[**Anna's Archive**](https://annas-archive.org/)
: An aggregator of various pirate services' databases of books and scientific
articles. If you can't find it here, you probably *can't* find it âˆ’ at least not
on the Internet.

[**1337x**](https://www.1377x.to/)
: A good source of torrents of all kinds.
